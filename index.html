     Problem-
 This application is on the major problem of wrecked cars
 layed beside the
 lane  just to rot with time,Does it rot out that fast?
 Nope  itâ€™s iron instead what happens is that as India is
 a tropical country so During Rainy season water seeps into the
 cars giving home to numerous numbers of mosquitoes and other
 diseases. What if
 I say there is a way to tackle this situation.
